## Cars Data Set

The cars data set is built into R. You can view the first several lines of this
data set by simply typing.

```{r}
head(mtcars)
```

You can bring up a scatterplot using the `plot()` command.

```{r}
plot(x = mtcars$cyl, y = mtcars$mpg)
```

Where you can specify the data to plot on the x and the y axes by specifying
the name of the data set, then use the `$` to pull out the specific column
of data that you're interested in.

#### Exercise 1
In the R chunk below, please provide the line of code that will produce a
scatterplot for the relationship between horsepower (`hp`) and weight (`wt`). You can see the resulting plot by clicking the "knit HTML" button again. Below the R chunk, please provide add a sentence or two to this document that describes the structure seen in the plot.

```{r}
mean(c(1,2,3))
```


`r 2 + 2`
